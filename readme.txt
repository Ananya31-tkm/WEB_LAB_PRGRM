HTML FILE CREATION:
I created an html document map of india by following steps like-
Used <title> tag for creating title like MAP OF INDIA
Then i used <img> tag and its src attribute for adding image
Then for making image interactive,i used image <map> for making image with clickable areas.
Then i found the coordinates for finding exact position of clickable areas.
By using all these i created an indiamap.html document
GIT'S SET UP:
First of all ,i created an account in github using username and password
Then i created a remote repository in github
Then i  created a repository in my local machine
Then copied all html files into the local repo
Then i opend git bah from that local repo and initialized  empty git repository
Then i used git add . command to add files to staging area
Then i use git config command
Then i use git commit command for creating a version or commit
Then i used remote add orgin "URL"
Then i pushed the files from local to remote repo using git push -u orgin master
Then i verified the changes using git status comman
End
